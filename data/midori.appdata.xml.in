Midori is a fast little WebKit browser with support for HTML5. It can manage
many open tabs and windows. The URL bar completes history, bookmarks, search
engines and open tabs out of the box. Web developers can use the powerful
web inspector that is a part of WebKit. Individual pages can easily be turned
into web apps and new profiles can be created on demand.

Many extensions are included by default such as Adblock with support for
ABP filter lists. Downloading via Aria2 or SteadyFlow. User scripts and styles
support a la Greasemonkey. Controlling cookies and scripts via NoJS and the
Cookie Security Manager. Having tabs in a vertical panel or popup window.
